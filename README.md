# Boot.dev AI Agent Project

This is my personal learning project from the Boot.dev "Build an AI Agent in Python" course.

**Important disclaimers**
- This is **educational code only** — not production-ready.
- It lacks full security features (input sanitization, robust error handling, rate limiting, authentication, etc.).
- Do **not** deploy this publicly or give it to others to run without heavy review and hardening.
- Built for learning purposes — use at your own risk.

See the course warning: "Do not give this program to others for them to use! It doesn't have all the security and safety features that a production AI agent would have."

Feel free to look, fork for your own learning, but please don't run it in any real/untrusted environment.
